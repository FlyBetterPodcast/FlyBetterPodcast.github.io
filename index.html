          <h3>What is the Jank Tank Open?</h3>
          <p>
            Hello and welcome everyone to the first ever Jank Tank Open, kicking
            off on April 3rd! As a collaboration between both the Fly Better and
            Gold Squadron Podcasts, this online Extended X-Wing event is a
            single elimination tournament run on the Vassal platform. However,
            all players participating in the Jank Tank Open will be using
            randomly generated squad lists from Yet Another Squad Builder
            instead of building their own from scratch. Players will choose one
            of 2 randomized squads assigned to them to play in the tournament.
            The only permitted changes to the squad are one upgrade that may be
            removed, and one upgrade that may be added.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both Gold Squadron and Fly Better are committed to making this a
            smooth and enjoyable online event. We understand that these are
            difficult times, and in the spirit of hopefulness, Gold Squadron and
            Fly Better will each donate $1 per Jank Tank Open participant to the
            charity of the winner’s choice. To those who are savvy enough to
            master their jank, other great prizes can be won as well. Please
            read the descriptions of the various tabs on this site so you are
            familiar with where to find various information.

          <h3>Tournament Summary</h3>
          <p>
            The Jank Tank Open is a single elimination Online X-Wing tournament
            utilizing the X-Wing 2nd Edition Vassal Module. Participating
            players will be assigned 1 randomly generated list for two factions:
            one chosen during sign up and the other randomly. Lists are created
            using the random squadron generator on Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0
            (https://raithos.github.io/).The format for this tournament is
            Extended to create a varied pool of choices for the randomizer. Once
            you get your squad options you may remove a single upgrade, and/or
            add a single upgrade. You will then choose one of your two squads to
            use for the event. When playing your games, player order is randomly
            decided at the start of the game via a die roll. A bid will not help
            you.
          </p>

          <p>
            Players are expected to be familiar with the rules of X-Wing Second
            Edition. This is a Casual level event. Resources are available here:

          </p>

          <h3>Random Generation Method</h3>
          <p>
            All squads will be generated randomly using the “Random” setting in
            Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0. The generation settings are below:
          </p>
          <div class="text-center">
            <img src="./builder.png" alt="..." />
          </div>

          <h3>Playing your games</h3>
          <p>
            Once registration has closed, two google sheets will be sent to all
            players. One contains all the players, their lists, vassal handles,
            and discord handles. This is for coordination with your opponent.
            The second contains everyone’s Round 1 Matchups, when they play (Use
            a UTC converter for the time), and whether the game has completed.
            Be sure to fill this out as you coordinate your time and complete
            your games.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Games are played to a total of 12 rounds.</strong></p>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Before your game begins please start a Vassal Log file.</strong
            >
            This can be done using these instructions:
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to save a log of a game, you must start the recording of
            the log before the game starts. This is done with the File
            Menu/Begin logfile. When you're ready to end it, go to File Menu/End
            Logfile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Player order is determined randomly. This can be done by one player
            rolling a die. If the result is hit/crit then they are the first
            player. <strong>They do not get to choose.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            If a rules dispute occurs that cannot be resolved, roll for it.
            After the game, email
