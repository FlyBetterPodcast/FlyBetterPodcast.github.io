        <h3>What is the Jank Tank Open?</h3>
        <p>
          Hello and welcome everyone to Jank Tank II, kicking off on January 3rd! As a collaboration between both the Fly Better
          and Gold Squadron Podcasts, this online Extended X-Wing event is a single elimination tournament run on the TableTop
          Simulator platform. However, all players participating in the Jank Tank Open will be using randomly generated squad
          lists from Yet Another Squad Builder instead of building their own. Players will choose one of 2 randomized squads
          assigned to them to play in the tournament. The only permitted changes to the squad are one upgrade that may be removed,
          and one upgrade that may be added.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Gold Squadron and Fly Better are committed to making this a smooth and enjoyable online event. We understand that
          these are difficult times, and in the spirit of hopefulness, Gold Squadron and Fly Better will each donate $1 per Jank
          Tank Open participant to the charity of the winner’s choice. Please read the descriptions of the various tabs on this
          site so you are familiar with where to find various information.

        <h3>Tournament Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The Jank Tank Open is a single elimination Online X-Wing tournament utilizing the X-Wing 2nd Edition TableTop Simulator
          Module. Participating players will be assigned 1 randomly generated list for two different factions chosen at sign up.
          Lists are created using the random squadron generator on Yet Another Squad Builder 2.0 (https://raithos.github.io/).The
          format for this tournament is Extended to create a varied pool of choices for the randomizer. Once you get your squad
          options you may remove a single upgrade, and/or add a single upgrade. You will then choose one of your two squads to use
          for the event.
        </p>

        <p>
          This event will be using the “Random Order After Dials” rules for determining player order. </p>
          <p>Determine Player Order:</p>
          <p>Randomly determine the first player as follows:</p>
            <li>Each player rolls 3 attack dice. The player with the most crit results is the first player.</li>
            <li>In case of a tie, the first player is the player with the most eyeball results.</li>
            <li>If there is still a tie, the first player is the player with the most hit results.</li>
            <li>If there is still a tie, players reroll the dice and follow the above rules until the tie is broken.</li>
        </p>

        <p>
          Players are expected to be familiar with the rules of X-Wing Second Edition. This is a Casual level event. Resources

        <img src="builder.png">


        <h3>Playing your games</h3>
        <p>
          Once registration has closed, a google sheet will be made available to all players. It contains all the players, their
          lists, and discord handles. Use it to schedule your weekly matchups which can be found on TTT
        </p>

        <p>
          If a rules dispute occurs that cannot be resolved, roll for it. This is a lighthearted tournament designed to be fun.
          By FFG standards this would be Casual Tier. Be flexible.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your opponent does not show up or is unresponsive to emails/communication attempts, please first ping an admin in
          the Gold Squadron Discord or email mynocklistcritiques@gmail.com. If players do not complete their match on time, and
          we have not been made aware of any issues, a winner will be randomly selected. A player may voluntarily concede a game
          if they run into scheduling conflicts, however we implore you to make time to play your matches.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Games are played to a total of 12 rounds.</strong></p>

        <h3>Prizes</h3>
        <p>
          There will be no physical prizes for this event, however, the winner will have 2 Dollars per Jank Tank II participant
          (Spit Between Gold Squadron and Fly Better) donated to charity of their choice. This charity must be approved by both
          Gold Squadron and Fly Better.
